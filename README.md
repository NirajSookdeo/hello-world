# hello-world
This is the first repository I'm making, expect it to be messy! 01-21-2022

Following the second step of the github tutorial, I'm going to write a bit about myself.
I'm a 22 year old student who will be graudating this semester with an AS in Computer Science.
I recently looked into the market and saw how vastly different the world of programming is and
that part of programming is getting involved in a community like Github, so I joined here!
I'm looking forward to experiencing what this community is like and I hope to provide meaningful
contributions! If you read this, thank you for taking the time out of your day to learn a little
about me. Feel free to contact me if you have any cool ideas!
